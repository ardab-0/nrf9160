3 Towers at
 tx1,ty1
 tx2,ty2
 tx3,ty3

With signal strengths s1, s2, s3

We calculate the weight of each signal. Essentially a number from 0 to 1 for each tower where the sum of the weights adds up to 1.

Weighted signal w1, w2, w3 where:
 w1 = s1/(s1+s2+s3)
 w2 = s2/(s1+s2+s3)
 w3 = s3/(s1+s2+s3)
